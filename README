Exploit for XSA 108

This is a linux kernel module that creates an entry in /proc called
'xensa108'. When read, this triggers rdmsr cpu instructions to read
MSRs in x2apic mode that xen should have disallowed.

When querying above the 256th register, Xen overflows its internal buffer
that stores the emulated register values. Only 4 bytes is pulled out of
the buffer for each MSR, even though this buffer holds 16 bytes per MSR.
This means that the data you get back is a set of 4 bytes within this
buffer, at 16 byte offset increments (there's 12 bytes you cannot
retrieve -- xen doesn't expose them). All in all, this means that 3
extra pages of memory are accessed beyond the end of the buffer. I suppose
it's also possible a page fault could occur, which would crash the
hypervisor.

INSTALL:

1) Make sure kernel headers are installed and you have a build system
   (on ubuntu: 'apt-get install build-essential module-assistant')
2) Run 'make'
3) Run 'insmod ./xensa108.ko'
4) strings /proc/xensa108 or od /proc/xensa108, etc.

TO REMOVE:

1) rmmod xensa108
